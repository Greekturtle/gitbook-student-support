# Superset Profile Photo Guidelines

Your Profile photo is visible to the companies where you have applied for a job. Hence, it is important for you to look professional and approachable. Striking the balance between a social site and a professional recruitment platform can be difficult, so we’ve put together some tips on how to take a profile picture for your Superset Profile.

### The DOs for Profile Photo -

**1. Take a headshot** 

For your Superset Profile Photo, it is therefore important that the ****face occupies most of the space. Don’t choose a picture taken far away on a mountain top! Show the employers your professional potential with a cracking smile!

**2. Pick an up-to-date photo**

We’ve all seen those photos on social media that were taken decades back and then seen them in person only to find out they look completely different! ****Make sure your photo was taken in the past few years and reflects how you look on a daily basis \(glasses, make-up, hair, etc\).

**3. Use a high resolution photo**

Try to avoid blurry images that do not have the right pixel size. Use a high quality photo with a good resolution. Your shining profile needs a shining photo!

**4. Take the photo in a professional attire**

We all have great photos that were taken when we were wearing a T-shirt, a nice top or a cool hoodie. But for a professional hiring platform like ours, we recommend you take your photo while wearing a shirt and/or a suit.

### The DON'Ts for Profile Photo -

#### **1. Don’t use filters**

Avoid filters at all costs. They detract from your picture, making it harder for employers to find out who you are.

#### **2. Don’t crop a group picture**

A cropped photo of you at a party is not professional, it shows a lack of commitment, instead of the best, professional version of yourself that you should be showing at all times.

#### **3. Don’t have a distracting background**

If you’ve managed to perfect your genuine, approachable face, why let it go to waste with a garish backdrop? Keep the background simple, so that your photo focuses purely on your face.
