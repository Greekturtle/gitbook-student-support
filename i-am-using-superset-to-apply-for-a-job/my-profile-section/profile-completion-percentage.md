# Profile Verification and Profile Completion Percentage

### Profile Verification

You might** **see - 'Your profile has been submitted for verification' at the top left corner of your My Profile page. If your college does not use Superset for placements and **you are using Superset only to apply for a job, then you can ignore this verification tag.**

### Profile Completion Percentage

The profile completion percentage is merely a representation of the number of sections that you have filled in the entire My Profile tab. It is definitely **NOT A CONSTRAINT and NOT A CRITERIA **for you to apply for jobs.&#x20;
