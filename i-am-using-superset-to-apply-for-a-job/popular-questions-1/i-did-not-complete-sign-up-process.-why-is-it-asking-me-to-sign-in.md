# I did not complete sign up process. Why is it asking me to sign in?

During registering/applying for a new job, you might be asked to sign in when you enter your email ID or phone number. This is because you had earlier registered with Superset or you have an incomplete registration from earlier. This might look like as in the screenshots shown below:

In this case please click on the Sign In button \(as shown above\) or go [www.app.joinsuperset.com](www.app.joinsuperset.com) and enter your email id and password. If you do not remember your password, use the 'Forgot Password' button or if you do not remember your email ID, us the 'Forgot Email ID' button.
