# Steps After Registration

After completing the job application process, we suggest you to regularly check the status of your job application under JOB PROFILES section \(after logging into your Superset account\).

Also, we encourage you to complete as many sections as possible under the 'My Profile' section so that recruiters can know about all your achievements.

Keep visiting the Job Profiles tab to see other jobs that are open for you!
