# When will I get my interview results?

Superset only provides a technology platform to employers to conduct their hiring process. Superset does not have any control over the announcement of results.&#x20;

Employers take up to three weeks to evaluate the results of the interviews and announce the result.

In case you think there is an issue, please write to the respective company's HR or fresher hiring support email address.&#x20;
