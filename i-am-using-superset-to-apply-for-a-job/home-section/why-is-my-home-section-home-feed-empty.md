# Why is my home section/home feed empty?

If you are using Superset Mobile App, please note that your HOME tab might be empty if your college placement office \(or training and placement office or career development office\) **does not use Superset.**

If the home feed looks empty, then this is not an error! Please proceed to the Job Profile section if you are using Superset to apply for a Job.

For a better experience, please use a laptop/desktop browser \(like Google Chrome app\) to use Superset.
