# How to get my profile verified?

### **If your college placement office \(or training and placement office or career development office or college administration\) USES Superset for Placements -** 

In this case, the profile verification is carried out by your college \(or the college's placement office\). Please get in touch with them to get your profile verified.

### **If your college placement office DOES NOT USE Superset for Placements -** 

In this case, there is no need to get your profile. You can directly apply for Jobs under the Job Profiles section.
