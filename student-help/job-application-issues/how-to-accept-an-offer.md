# How to accept an offer?

{% hint style="warning" %}
You will only be able to **Accept** an offer after the company you have applied for has enabled the job acceptance button

If you cannot see the **Accept** button then that means it has not yet been enabled. Please be patient.
{% endhint %}

* After opening the job profile, you should be able to see the **Accept** button
