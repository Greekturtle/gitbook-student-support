# I have been offerred the job but I cannot see the Accept button

{% hint style="warning" %}
You will only be able to **Accept** an offer after the company you have applied for has enabled the job acceptance button

If you cannot see the **Accept** button then that means it has not yet been enabled. Please be patient.

If you are still concerned about this issue, please reach out to the hiring team of the company you have applied for.
