# When will I get my results?

### If you are applying for an on-campus job profile

{% hint style="info" %}
Please refer to this section only **if your college placement office \(or training and placement office or career development office or college administration\) USES Superset for Placements**

You should get an app notification, email, or text message alert whenever a result is announced or the shortlist is published. 

Please be patient and wait for the same.

### If you are applying for an off-campus job profile

The company whose placement process you are applying for should reach out to you with your result.
