# OTP is wrong/ OTP not received

For Email OTP: **Please check your Spam folder and Update folder as well.** The OTP email might have gone there.

We understand that you are having issues with email/phone number OTP. There have been some issues at our end and we apologise for the same. We understand that job application is a tiring process and we appreciate you being patient with us.  
  
For mobile OTP: If your college uses Superset for placements, then the Mobile OTP verification is compulsory for you. If your college does not use Superset for placements, then it is not compulsory for you. During peak hours, the OTP might take 5 mins to reach to you.
