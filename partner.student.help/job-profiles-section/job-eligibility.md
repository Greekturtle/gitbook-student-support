# Job Eligibility Criteria - Why am I not eligible for a job?

Whenever a company posts a job opening on Superset, they set some eligibility criteria for the students. Based on this EligIbility Criteria you may be eligible or not eligible for the Job. For example, the eligibility criteria can be - 60% in 10th and 12th class, B.E. candidates only.

### Where can I check my eligibility - 

* When you enter the 'Job Profiles' section and click on a Job Opening, on the top right hand side, you will see **'Apply for this profile' if you are eligible for the job.**
