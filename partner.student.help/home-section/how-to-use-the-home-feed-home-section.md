# How to use the home feed/home section?

If your **college uses Superset for placements**, the Home Section allows your college's placement office to directly reach out to you for updates regarding upcoming placement events, new companies etc.

We encourage students to regularly check the Home Feed to stay updated with the information from your college's placement office. You can even post a comment on the updates posted in the Home Section to get your queries answered.
