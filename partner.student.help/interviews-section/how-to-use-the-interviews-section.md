# My interview was not scheduled

Scheduling of interviews is done by the company whose job profile you have applied for. Your test will be scheduled as per the day and time decided by the hiring company. Interviews will be scheduled only if you have applied for the Job. Go to the Job Profiles page to see if you have applied for that job.

Please be patient until then. In case of further concern, please reach out to the placement office \(only if your college uses Superset for placements\) of your college or the hiring team of the company you have applied to.
