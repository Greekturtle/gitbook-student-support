# Profile Verification and Profile Completion Percentage

### Profile Verification

You might ****see - 'Your profile has been submitted for verification' at the top left corner of your My Profile page. If your **college uses Superset for placement,** this verification will be carried out by your college's placement office. If you have any concerns regarding verification, please get in touch with your college's placement office.

If your **college does not use Superset for placements** and you are using Superset only to apply for a job, then you can ignore this verification tag.

### Profile Completion Percentage

The profile completion percentage is merely a representation of the number of sections that you have filled in the entire My Profile tab. It is definitely **NOT A CONSTRAINT** for you to appear in placements or to apply for jobs.
