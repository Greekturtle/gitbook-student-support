# During registration it says 'Roll Number already exists'. What to do?

Please check that you entered the correct roll number allotted to you by your college. Check for Capital and Small letters in your roll number. If you still cannot proceed in the registration, and if your **college uses Superset for placements,** then please get in touch with your college's placement office. You can also get in touch with us by clicking 'Contact Support' below.
