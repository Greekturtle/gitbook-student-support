# I'm getting an error while applying for the job profile by Wipro.

If the error says "You have reached maximum number of job applications for this group." this is happening because you have already applied for the job profile in the company. This is as per the Wipro's policy.

Additionally, you can write to helpdesk.recruitment@wipro.com for more details and clarification.
