# I cannot edit my college name / roll number / Email ID after registration. How to change it?

Students are not allowed to edit these Superset account details after registration - College name, Roll Number and Email ID, as this information is shared with the employer once you apply for a  job. 

During Registration, once the name, email ID and roll number are submitted, we do not allow editing these details. If you think that you have entered incorrect details while registration, please click on the contact support button below to get in touch with us by clicking the 'Contact Support' button below.
