# I cannot edit my college name / roll number / Email ID after registration. How to change it?

* Students are not allowed to edit these Superset account details after registration - College name, Roll Number and Email ID, as this information is shared with the employer once you apply for a  job. 
* During Registration, once the name, email ID and roll number are submitted, we do not allow editing these details.
* If you have entered incorrect information in any of these three fields, please get in touch with us by clicking on 'Contact Support' button below.
