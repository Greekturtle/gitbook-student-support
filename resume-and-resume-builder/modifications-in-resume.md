# Modifications in Resume

Once the resume is built, you have an option to edit & delete unwanted sections. These options are available in the extreme right once the intended section is selected.

In the control panel you will find all the sections. Any point removed from a particular section in the resume, appears in these sections so that it can be added again if required. You also have an option to add page breaks, hide section headings and to delete the entire section.
