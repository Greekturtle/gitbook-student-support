If you are reading this, chances are you have been asked by a future employer to complete an interview on Superset and the best way to give your best _shot_  is to prepare before you give the actual interview.

This article is going to familiarise you to the Superset Studio interfacing for completing the interview.&#x20;

### Welcome Page

### Interview Studio

Once you start your interview, you will see the question on the top and the recorder screen.

The countdown to the recording will start automatically. This is the time for your preparation.\
After each question, **you will get 30 to 120 seconds to prepare **(based on the preparation time configured by the interviewer)

Once the countdown is over, the recording will start automatically.

**You can stop the recording when your answer is complete, else, the recording will stop automatically once the maximum time for answer has elapsed.**\

****The maximum time to answer has been set by the recruiter. You will be notified when you have 20 seconds to answer the question.
{% endhint %}

Once the recording is stoped, either manually by you or automatically on end of record time, the video will be uploaded automatically.



Once you have finished recording responses to all questions, you can close the window. All your responses are saved on Superset automatically.
